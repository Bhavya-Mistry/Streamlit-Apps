## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

To run these Streamlit applications on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Navigate to an App Directory and Run:**
    Each application is located in its own sub-directory. To run a specific app, navigate into its directory and execute the Streamlit command.

    For example, to run the "Linear Regression" app:
    ```bash
    cd linear_regression_app/ # Assuming your app is in a folder named linear_regression_app
    streamlit run app.py     # Or whatever your main app file is called (e.g., main.py, demo.py)
    ```
    (You will need to replace `linear_regression_app/` and `app.py` with the actual directory and file names of your applications.)

    Once you run the command, a new tab will open in your web browser displaying the Streamlit application.
