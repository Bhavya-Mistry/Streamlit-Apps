## About

This project is an interactive tool built with Streamlit to demonstrate the application of various classification algorithms on the **Iris dataset**. The Iris dataset is a classic in machine learning, comprising measurements of iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and their corresponding species.

The application allows users to:
* Preview the Iris dataset.
* Select from three popular classification models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.
* Train the selected model on a split of the data.
* View the model's accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a detailed classification report.

This tool is perfect for understanding how different classifiers perform on a simple, well-understood dataset and for visualizing their results.
